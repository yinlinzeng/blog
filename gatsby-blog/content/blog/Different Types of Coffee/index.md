## 原文
​	My name is Mike Jones and I'm a **barista** at Third Rail Coffee right by Washington Square Park in New York City. I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making skills. So especially in recent years, you may have noticed that bags of coffee that you've bought from either cafés or coffee roasters have started adding a lot more information, such as **varietal**, **altitude,** the farm that it comes from. And so it's hard to actually know, what does that mean? Like, how is it going to taste. There's sort of a basic **category** that you can put some beans in and those are the Indonesia growing region, East Africa, and then Central/South America. Indonesian coffees tend to be very earthy, they have this sort of very heavy body to them. They're often used as the undertone in espresso blends. East African coffees tend to be fruitier, livelier, kind of wine-like. And then Central/South Americans have a little bit more base to them, some darker, deeper notes to them. Another way that coffees differ is the processing, and there are two main ways. These are natural and wash-processed. Wash-process is taking over a little bit more just because there's a less chance of defect in the bean. What happens in natural is after the cherry is picked, it is simply left out to dry with the fruit on for a certain amount of time, and this creates like really crazy fruit flavors, but also ferment is rampant. With washed, it's cleaner, flavors are more nuanced and balanced and more delicate. And in Central and South America, washed is sort of the standard. Countries like Costa Rica it's actually the law. Whereas in East Africa, Ethiopia in particular, there's such a water shortage that people are naturally processing everything and having defective beans. But in recent years there have been economically feasible ways of actually doing a wash process using special machines in Ethiopia, so we've been seeing a lot more exciting coffees come from East Africa that are cleaner, less fermented, and just more balanced and exciting.

## Translation  

我是Mike Jones，一位咖啡师，目前在纽约华盛顿广场的Third Rail Coffee工作。我要告诉你一些咖啡的基本知识。最近几年，也许你有发现，从咖啡馆或这咖啡烘焙坊买的的咖啡包装袋上面开始多了很多资讯，比如品种、海拔高度或产地。很难懂它到底是什么意思？像是它的口味如何？这里有个基本分类让你区分这些咖啡豆分别是印度尼西亚产区、东非和中南美洲产区。印度尼西亚的咖啡带有泥土气息，它们非常浓醇。常常用来当浓缩咖啡的基调。东非的咖啡比较偏向果香味，清爽的口感，有点像酒。而中南美洲咖啡较丰富，有些更浓郁，更厚实。另一种分类方式是处理过程的不同，主要有两种方式-日晒和水洗。水洗法略胜一筹，因为豆子的瑕疵率较低。日晒法则是在咖啡果实采收后连同果肉一起日晒干燥一段时间，因此有浓郁果香，但也有强烈的发酵气味。水洗处理的话，较干净，香味也较有层次，平衡且更精致。中南美洲产区，水洗处理是最普遍的。在某些国家，例如哥斯达黎加，水洗处理时规定。然而在东非，尤其是伊索比亚，因为水资源缺乏，大家都以日晒法处理，因此有一些瑕疵豆，但近年来发展了经济实惠的方式，现在伊索比亚采用了特殊机器进行水洗处理。所以我们才能看到跟多品质良好的东非咖啡豆，更醇净，少发酵为，口感更平衡而具吸引力。
