## 原文
​	It's very important to realize that obesity is an illness that affects you from your head to your toes,meaning that it really does affect every part of your body.Obesity leads to an increased risk of heart disease,high blood pressure,also it can lead to increased risk of **diabetes**.In addition,liver problems are associated with being obese.In fact,**liver transplant** is now becoming necessary in many patients who are obese,because obesity can lead to **cirrhosis** of the liver, **necessitating** a need for a new liver.Something that many people don't know is that obesity can cause an increased risk in many cancers,and these are cancers such as breast cancer, **prostate** cancer,**ovarian** cancer,and even **colon** cancer. **Infertility** is a problem that effects many people and obesity is sometimes the **culprit**,and this is true for both men and women.For women,there's something called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome,or PCOS,and oftentimes this is associated with obesity,and so women may not ovulate and therefore,they're not able to get pregnant.And in men,obesity does affect the quality of the sperm.The good news though is that if you do lose the weight,many times a lot of these health problems can be reversed.Sleep apnea is an illness that is associated with obesity that many people aren't even aware that they have.Sleep apnea occurs when you're sleeping,and you actually stop breathing for periods of time, and your oxygen level becomes dangerously low. The good news though,is that sleep apnea is something that is reversed in many people,once they're able to lose even a small amount of weight.So these are just a few of the many health problems that are caused by obesity.

**肥胖导致的健康问题**

​	意识到这一点非常重要，肥胖症是一种能影响你从头到脚即全身各个部位的疾病。肥胖导致了心脏病、高血压的患病风险提高，它同样能导致糖尿病的患病风险提升。此外，肝脏问题和肥胖息息相关。事实上，肝脏移植对于许多肥胖病人来说很必要，因为肥胖能导致肝硬化，这样就迫切需要换一个新的肝脏。很多人不知道一件事，肥胖能导致许多癌症的患病风险上升，浙西癌症包括乳癌、前列腺癌、子宫癌甚至是结肠癌。不孕不育是一个困扰很多人的问题，肥胖有时就是那个罪魁祸首，这就是在男人女人之间都是真实的。对于女人来说，有多囊卵巢综合征，时常就和肥胖有关联，因而这些女人有可能排不了卵，所以她们就怀不了孕。同样对于男人来说，肥胖也确实影响了精子的质量。好消息不过就是如果你确实减肥了，大概率很多健康问题就不会发生了。睡眠窒息症是一种肥胖有关的疾病，很多人甚至没意识到他们患上了这种病。睡眠窒息症发生时你还处于睡眠状态，你实际上停止了一小会的呼吸，你的氧气水平变得很低。好消息是不过就是睡眠窒息症对于很多人来说是可以预防的，因为他们能够去减掉一点体重。所以这仅仅是一些肥胖导致的许多健康问题。
