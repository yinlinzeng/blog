I've been reading books of old.

The legends and the myths.

Achilles and his gold.

Hercules and his gifts.

Spiderman's control.

And Batman with his fists.

And clearly I don't see myself upon that list.

I'm not looking for somebody.

With some Superhuman gifts

Some Superhero

Some fairytale bliss

Just something I can turn to 

Somebody I can kiss

**I want something just like this**

Doo doo doo....

Oh I want something just like this

Doo doo doo...

...

The testaments they told 

The moon and its eclipse

And Superman unrolls

A suit before he lifts 

But I'm not the kind of person that it fits 

She said where'd you wanna go 

How much you wanna risk

I'm not looking for somebody

With some Superhuman gifts

Some Superhero

Some fairytale bliss

Just something I can turn to

Somebody I can miss

...
