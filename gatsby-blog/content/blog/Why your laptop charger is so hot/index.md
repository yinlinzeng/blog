| So, I have this problem. When I plug my laptop charger into an outlet, that weird box between the plug and the part where it connects to my computer,it gets super hot, like I can't even touch it. | 所以，我有这样一个问题。当我把平板充电器插入插头，在插头和连接我们电脑那部分之间有一个奇怪的盒子会变得特别烫，我甚至没法去碰它 |
| So, I've invited Audrey Quinn from NPR's                     | 所以，我已经邀请了npr的audrey quinn。                        |
| Planet Money team to help explain what's going on with my super-hot laptop charger. | 来解释我的超级热的平板充电器是怎么回事。                     |
| So, Audrey, what's the deal? QUINN: "The first thing you have to understand is | 所以，Audrey，这是怎么回事呢？Quinn:首先你应该了解的是       |
| that the kind of power that comes out of your wall is actually different from the kind of power that your electronics want. | 从墙外接进来的电的种类是和你电器需要的电是不一样的           |
| It comes out in the form of alternating current electricity. | 从外面来的是以交流电的形式                                   |
| That means the electrons are pulsing back and forth          | 这就意味着电脉冲来回变换。                                   |
| And your electronics want what's called direct current power, that's where the electrons | 你的电器需要的是直流电，这种电                               |
| are flowing straight like a river. So, they have to convert it. And when they | 像河流一样直直的流动。所以，它们需要去转换它。并且当它们     |
| do that conversion energy is wasted, so what you're feeling is energy lost in the | 这么做的话，转换的能量就会被消耗，所以你就会感觉能量以热量损失。“ |
| form of heat." Okay, so, why can't I just power my laptop with alternating current? | ok，所以为什么不能用交流电来给我的平板充电呢？               |
| If that's coming out of the wall? QUINN: "Yeah, that works just fine for things like | 毕竟从墙外进来的就是交流电啊？quinn: "是的，那对一些东西是挺好的 |
| lightbulbs or a hairdryer, but electronics are a little more complicated.---- | 比如电灯，吹风机，但是电器是有些复杂的                       |
| If you were to send that alternating current power directly to your laptop, you'd probably | 如果你直接用交流电去充你的平板的话，你可能会看到一缕蓝色的烟。” |
| see a puff of blue smoke." Oh god, that sounds bad.          | 我的天呀，那听起来很糟糕。                                   |
| Okay, so, if DC power is so great, why don't we just have it in our houses in the first | ok，所以如果直流电这么好，为什么我们不能在家里直接用直流电来呢？ |
| place?   This goes back to the late 1800s. There were        | 这个要追溯到18世纪后期，有两个                               |
| two guys who represented the two different kinds of power.   | 人代表两种不同的电力。                                       |
| There was Thomas Edison, he was all about DC power, and then there's Nikola Tesla, | 爱迪生主张直流电，而特斯拉主张用交流电。                     |
| he's your AC guy. They're totally duking it out. Everytime   | 他们为此一直争论不休。每当                                   |
| a new building goes in, it's kind of this 'oh, what's going to happen? Are they | 有新建筑要建成，人们会观察他们是否要使用交流还是直流？       |
| going to use AC or DC?' What happens eventually is that AC power is | 但最后大多数情况是使用交流电来供长途运输                     |
| much better at traveling long distances. So,ultimately, the entire power grid gets | 所以，最后整个电力系统都是用交流电来传导。                   |
| set up to spread AC power." But today we have all of these devices. | 但是今天我们所有的设备。                                     |
| We have smart phones, we have electric cars, we have tablets, we have computers, | 我们有智能手机，有电动汽车，有平板，有计算机。               |
| and all these things are hungry for DC power. Do you think we could ever switch back | 所有的这些东西都是用直流供电的。你觉得我们可以换回来直流电吗 |
| and maybe realize Edison's original dream                    | 或许可以实现爱迪生的直流电进入每家每户的梦想？               |
| of DC power in every home? QUINN: "The US has one of the best, most reliable | quinn:"美国已经有一个全世界最好最可靠的电力系统              |
| power grids in the world, so people aren't saying 'let's knock out this entire grid.' | 所以人们不会再说’让我们砍掉整个电力系统重新来过‘             |
| You could just have one converter box in your house,and that way you're not converting | 你只需要在你的房子里装一个转换器，那样的话你就不用每个电器上都转换一次。 |
| AC to DC at the level of every single device." So, if we can reduce the number of conversions | 所以如果我们能够减低交流到直流间的转换次数的话，             |
| from AC power to DC power, even a little bit, we're going to save a lot of energy. | 即使是一点点，我们也能节省下大量的电能。                     |
