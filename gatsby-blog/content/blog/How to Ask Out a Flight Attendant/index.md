## 原文
​	Flight attendants get hit on all the time,so if you want your sincere interest to stand out,you'll have to set yourself apart from the crowd.You will need **Charm** **Chivalry** and a business card.

​	Step 1.Dress in clean,neat business clothes. You'll immediately distinguish yourself from the 90 percent of flyers who have dressed for comfort--you know, the ones whose **gnarly** toes are sticking out of their out of their flip-flops.

​	Step 2.If at all possible,sit in First or Business Class;deserved or not,it immediately gives you credibility.A good way to sit in First Class without paying a fortune is to use your frequent-flyer miles for an **upgrade**.

​	Step 3.Flash a winning smile at the target of your desire as you board and offer a sincere "Hello." Flight attendants are used to being ignored when they welcome passengers,so this will make you stand out as someone with manners.Hold eye contact for a second longer than normal; it's been proven to unnerve people in a way that sexually excites them.

​	Step 4. Decline the champagne.Accepting a glass of bubbly upon boarding is for giddy novices.

​	Step 5.Look for an opportunity to show your chivalrous side.For example,you could jump up and help her as she struggles to hoist someone's 200-pound carry-on into an overhead compartment.

​	Step 6.Be unfailingly polite throughout the flight--say "please" and "thank you" and don't ring the bell unless you're choking to death.The longer the flight goes on,the more she'll be comparing you favorably to the regular pains-in-the-asses.Read something that makes you look intelligent and successful,and that invites conversation--like a manual that suggests you are learning to fly your own plane.

​	Step 7.Aside from when you are offering a heartfelt "please" and "thank you," ignore her.You don't want to be lumped in with all the leering lotharios and their cheesy come-ons.

​	Step 8.When the captain instructs the flight crew to take their seats for landing,take out a business card and jot down a note to the effect of ,"Dear Sandy,I'd love to take you to [an expensive restaurant] for dinner one night."

​	Step 9.As she offers her "buh-bye," thank her for a wonderful flight as you smile,make eye contact,and slip he your card.

​	Step 10.Start saving your money;you'll need it for that pricey dinner when she phones.

​	**Did you know In a survey of professions that men find sexy,flight attendants came in third,after models and dancers.**
